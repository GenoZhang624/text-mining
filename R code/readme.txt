For each chunk of the code, firstly install the needed packages, then annotate them and use the library() function to import the packages into the environment.Copy the API key from the "keys.txt" document provided to achieve the authentication.We use the hashtag to search the tweet instead of the keyword, set number of tweets we collect is 2000 (it is a reasonable threshold for searching tweets with some specific hashtags which do not have such number of tweets in the recent 6-9 days)For collecting the tweets of character "ki-jung (ki-jeong)", please use the annotated code I provided (which we discuss the challenge of the character name in translation)In datasets folder: (for reading in the data, please use as datasets/#xxxx.csv)#parasite.csv is collected by using the hashtag #parasite, with 2000 observations, 17 variables. #ki-jeong.csv is collected by using the hashtag #ki-jeong, with 47observations, 17 variables.#ki-jung.csv is collected by using the hashtag #ki-jung, with 75 observations, 17 variables.#kim-daughter.csv is a combination of #ki-jung.csv and #ki-jeong.csv, with 122 observations, 17 variables.#ki-taek.csv is collected by using the hashtag #ki-taek, with 5 observations, 17 variables.#ki-woo.csv is collected by using the hashtag #ki-woo, with 22 observations, 17 variables.#Da-hye.csv is collected by using the hashtag #Da-hye, with 13 observations, 17 variables.#Chung-sook.csv is collected by using the hashtag # Chung-sook, with 21 observations, 17 variables.After reading in the dataset, we found the variable in the data is "text" rather than "Text", so we use "dataset$text" to obtain the text part of the tweets.In the data cleaning part, the original code does the lowercase measure before removing the retweet head "RT@", it will keep the retweet head in lowercase. For removing that, we inverse the sequence of these two measures.

In the code chunk for counting the term frequency, we edit the sequence and value of as.POSIXct() function arguments, as (data, tz, format), and change the format value "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S +0000 %Y" as "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS"In the last chunk of code, use the #parasite hashtag to search 10000 tweets and create the latitude and longitude value with all available tweets and profile geo-location data. Then mapping those tweets in the world map to acquire the geographical distribution.
